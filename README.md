# SVG Generator
  

## Description

![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue )

In this project I have developed a command line application that takes user input using the Inquirer package to dynamically create a SVG file. 
I did this because it is useful to be able to quickly make small logos for projects so I don't have to learn complicated software or hire a graphic designer.
This project helped me further my familiarity using Node.js and npm packages to develop a command line aplication. 
It also strengthened my knowledge of using classes in Javascript as well as using the jest test suite.

To install the project simply clone the repo to a directory on your machine. Example installation shown in the video below

## Usage

Once installed, open the project directory in your terminal and run ``` npm i ``` in the command line. This will install any dependancies needed. Then run ``` node index.js``` and answer the questions. The READMe will be generated in the the directory.

## Credits

In this project I used Node, Inquirer, and Jest, as well as ChaptGPT to make regex.
